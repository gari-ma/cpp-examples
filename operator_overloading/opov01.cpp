// basic operator overloading concept
/*
We can overload all the operators except:
1. dot operator (.)
2. scope resolution operator (::)
3. sizeof operator
4. conditional operator (?:)

We can overload the +,=,-,++,--,<,>
We can also overload type conversion operator like float(),int() as
Type cast operator does not have return type as they must return corresponding type

operator float() {
    float a = feet + inch/2;
    return a;

}
